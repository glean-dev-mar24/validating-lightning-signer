## Intro
Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) is an open-source **Rust library for secure, self-custodial Lightning signers**. Unlike hot wallets or blind signers, VLS keeps your private keys off the node **and** validates each signing request, ensuring only legitimate channel operations are approved. In other words, even if your Lightning node were compromised, funds remain safe thanks to the signerâ€™s rigorous policy checks.

## System Overview
---
VLS splits Lightning key management into two primary components:

1. **Lightning Node**  
   Runs the usual LN logic: channel opening, routing, HTLC management, etc. But **no** private keys for signing are stored here.

2. **Remote Validating Signer**  
   Stores private keys in a secure environment and **validates** each request (e.g., channel updates, HTLC commitments) before generating a signature. If the request fails policy checks, it denies signing.

```

**Additional Components**  
- **Policy Engine**: A customizable set of rules ensuring no suspicious or off-protocol requests are signed.  
- **UTXO Oracle (Optional)**: The signer can be configured to receive chain data to detect remote breaches or track on-chain states (e.g., unconfirmed inputs, HTLC expiries).  
- **State Storage**: Provides secure, redundant cloud storage for Lightning nodes and signers with anti-rollback protection.


## Architecture Overview
---
Below is a simplified technical breakdown of how VLS integrates with Lightning nodes:

1. **Integration Points**  
   - **c-lightning/CLN**: Use the `vls-hsmd` plugin so the nodeâ€™s signing calls are forwarded to VLS.  
   - **LDK**: Use the `lnrod` example or similar to route signing requests to the VLS library.

2. **Validation Flow**  
   1. **Node** proposes a transaction or state update.  
   2. **VLS** checks protocol correctness and local policy (e.g., channel open, HTLC amounts, no double revoke).  
   3. **If valid**, the signer returns a signature. Otherwise, it rejects the request.

3. **Hardware vs. Software Deployment**  
   - VLS can run in a dedicated hardware security module (HSM), a secure enclave, or simply as a separate process/container.  
   - For extremely large LN balances, hardware isolation is recommended.

4. **Performance & Scalability**  
   - Rust ensures efficient, safe concurrency.  
   - The overhead for real-time transaction signing is minimal compared to typical LN operations.  

## Getting Started
---
### Option 1: CLN + VLS
- [CLN & VLS Setup Guide](../Get-Started/cln-vls.md)  
- Basic steps:
  1. Perform one-time dependencies install.  
  2. Build and install `vls-hsmd`.  
  3. Configure `lightningd` to use the remote signer plugin.  
  4. Start your LN node + VLS signer processes.

### Option 2: LDK + VLS
- [LDK & VLS Guide](../Get-Started/ldk-vls.md)  
- Basic steps:
  1. Clone the `lnrod` repository (a reference LDK node).  
  2. Integrate the `vls-proxy` crate for signing.  
  3. Test basic LN operations to confirm validation.

### Option 3: Dockerized VLS
- [Docker Setup Guide](../Get-Started/docker.md)  
- Use pre-built Docker images for a single test environment or multi-service deployment including `bitcoind`, `CLN`, `txood` (UTXO oracle), and VLS signer.
