## Setup Development Tree

For development use a single tree can be setup which contains all components.
For this purpose both the `CLNHOST` and `VLSHOST` in subsequent procedures
refer to the same machine.

1. [One Time Setup](./one-time-setup.md)
2. [Run CLN Integration Tests](./cln-integration.md)
3. [VLS Environment Variables](./vls-env.md)
